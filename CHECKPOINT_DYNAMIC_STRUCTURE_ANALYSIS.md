# Checkpoint Dynamic Structure Analysis

## Current System Architecture

### Checkpoint 2 (Communication) - DYNAMIC
**Question Structure**: Questions themselves change based on Checkpoint 1 selections
**Not Fixed**: Different role types see completely different question sets

**Example - Question 1 "Written Communication Types":**
- **Client-facing roles**: See client emails, proposals, difficult conversations
- **Technical roles**: See technical docs, bug reports, code reviews  
- **Creative roles**: See creative briefs, social media, feedback requests
- **Internal roles**: See team updates, process docs, coordination

**Result**: 4+ different question variations per question

### Checkpoint 3 (Quality Control) - DYNAMIC
**Question Structure**: Questions adapt based on role type
**Not Fixed**: Quality materials and error types change completely

**Example - Quality Check Materials:**
- **Creative roles**: Brand guidelines, visual materials, marketing assets
- **Technical roles**: Code documentation, data reports, system configs
- **Business roles**: Financial reports, compliance materials, sales docs

**Result**: 4+ different question variations per question

### Checkpoint 4 (Pressure) - DYNAMIC
**Question Structure**: Pressure scenarios change based on role requirements
**Not Fixed**: Crisis scenarios are role-specific

**Example - Crisis Scenarios:**
- **Client-facing**: Multiple urgent client requests, relationship pressure
- **Technical**: System downtime, debugging under time constraints
- **Creative**: Design revision cycles, creative approval pressure
- **Internal**: Multi-department coordination, competing priorities

**Result**: 4+ different scenario variations per question

## Skills Challenge Generation Architecture

### Current Design: HYBRID APPROACH
**Not infinite AI generation**: Template-based with dynamic context injection
**Not fixed scenarios**: Company-specific customization of base templates

### Challenge Generation Process:

1. **Base Template Selection** (Fixed foundation challenges)
   - Communication Challenge Template
   - Quality Control Template  
   - Pressure/Multitasking Template
   - Role-Specific Template

2. **Dynamic Context Injection** (Company-specific customization)
   - Employer's actual communication scenarios → Injected into communication challenges
   - Employer's actual quality failures → Injected into error-detection challenges
   - Employer's actual crisis situations → Injected into pressure challenges
   - Employer's actual brand/process standards → Injected into role-specific challenges

3. **Role-Type Filtering** (Template selection)
   - Technical roles get code-review templates with employer's specific coding standards
   - Creative roles get design-review templates with employer's specific brand guidelines
   - Client-facing roles get communication templates with employer's specific client scenarios

### Example Challenge Generation:

**Base Template**: "Professional Email Communication Challenge"
**Employer Context Injection**: 
- Client complaint: "Budget concerns about project scope"
- Company tone: "Professional but warm, avoid legal language"
- Response time: "Same day for client concerns"
- Escalation: "CC manager on complex billing discussions"

**Generated Challenge**: Bespoke email scenario using employer's actual language, policies, and standards

## Total Scenario Combinations

### Checkpoint Questions:
- **Checkpoint 2**: 8 questions × 4 role types = 32 question variations
- **Checkpoint 3**: 7 questions × 4 role types = 28 question variations  
- **Checkpoint 4**: 9 questions × 4 role types = 36 question variations
- **Total**: 96 different question pathway combinations

### Skills Challenges:
- **Base Templates**: ~12 core challenge templates
- **Role-Type Variations**: 4 role adaptations per template = 48 role-specific templates
- **Company Customization**: Infinite variations through context injection
- **Result**: 48 base templates × infinite company context = Infinite bespoke challenges

## Entry-Level Calibration

**All challenges automatically scaled for zero experience:**
- Process-based evaluation (logical steps vs expertise)
- Learning orientation assessment (feedback handling)
- Growth mindset testing (question-asking behavior)
- Company culture fit (communication style alignment)

**No difficulty selection needed** - employers configure scenarios, system auto-calibrates for entry-level assessment.
