## Interview Support & Accessibility

**ADHD reasonable adjustments requested:** James would benefit from receiving interview questions 24 hours in advance, which allows him to organise his thoughts and present his analytical skills at their best. With ADHD, he processes information deeply but needs time to structure his responses without the pressure of thinking on the spot. A quiet interview environment with minimal distractions helps him focus and demonstrate his genuine capabilities rather than being hindered by executive function challenges.
