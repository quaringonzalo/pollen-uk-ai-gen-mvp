### 2. Profile Content Accuracy Check
Each personality type's behavioral components must reflect the dominant color's core characteristics:

- **Green-dominant types**: Focus on support, reliability, patience, team harmony
- **Blue-dominant types**: Focus on quality, precision, analysis, systematic approach
- **Red-dominant types**: Focus on results, speed, decisiveness, challenge-seeking
- **Yellow-dominant types**: Focus on people, enthusiasm, optimism, relationship-building

### 3. Example Corrected Profile: "The Steady Organiser" (Green 40%+ Blue 25%+)

- **Brief DISC Summary**: "Reliable and thorough"
- **Communication Style**: "Patient and supportive - creates safe spaces for discussion while ensuring all details are covered"
- **Decision-Making Style**: "Collaborative and careful - builds consensus while maintaining quality standards"
- **Career Motivators**: ["Stable, supportive team environment", "Helping others succeed", "Building lasting systems", "Quality work that serves others"]
- **Work Style Strengths**: ["Creates reliable processes", "Supports team success", "Maintains consistent quality", "Builds trust through dependability"]

The Green dominance drives the supportive, people-focused characteristics, while the Blue secondary adds the organisational and quality elements - but never overshadows the primary Green traits.
