# Candidate Skills Scoring System

## Overview

The Pollen platform uses a sophisticated multi-layer scoring system that evaluates candidates across three key dimensions: **Skills Assessment**, **Behavioral Compatibility**, and **Community Engagement**. This system is designed specifically for the 18-30 demographic with a focus on potential rather than traditional credentials.

## Core Scoring Philosophy

### 1. Skills-First Approach
- **No Educational/Experience Screening**: Platform deliberately excludes academic qualifications and work experience as filtering criteria
- **Practical Demonstration**: Skills are assessed through real-world challenges rather than theoretical tests
- **Potential Over Pedigree**: System evaluates learning ability and problem-solving approach rather than prior achievements

### 2. Holistic Assessment
- **Multi-Dimensional Evaluation**: Combines practical skills, behavioral fit, and community engagement
- **Dynamic Weighting**: Scoring adapts to specific job requirements and employer priorities
- **Entry-Level Optimization**: Calibrated for candidates with limited professional experience

## Three-Tier Scoring System

### Tier 1: Job Matching Algorithm (For Employers)
**Purpose**: Ranks candidates for employer review
**Weighting**: 60% Skills + 30% Behavioral + 10% Proactivity

```javascript
// Example calculation for job matching
const overallCompatibility = Math.round(
  (skillsScore * 0.6) + 
  (behavioralScore * 0.3) + 
  (proactivityScore * 0.1)
);
```

**Skills Score Calculation**:
- **Education-Based Potential** (30%): Highest qualification level as indicator of learning ability
- **Learning Activity Engagement** (40%): Participation in workshops, masterclasses, skill-building events
- **Application Engagement** (30%): Quality of application submissions and platform interaction

**Behavioral Score Calculation**:
- **DISC Profile Alignment** (40%): Match between candidate's behavioral profile and job requirements
- **Work Style Compatibility** (35%): Alignment with company culture and working environment
- **Communication Style Match** (25%): Compatibility with team communication preferences

**Proactivity Score Calculation**:
- **Community Participation** (40%): Questions asked, comments posted, helping others
- **Learning Commitment** (35%): Consistent engagement with educational content
- **Quality Contributions** (25%): Peer-validated helpful contributions to community

### Tier 2: Bespoke Challenge Scoring (For Applications)
**Purpose**: Evaluates specific application performance
**System**: Dynamic category generation based on employer requirements

#### Dynamic Category Generation Process

**Step 1: Employer Configuration Analysis**
- **Checkpoint 1 (Role Tasks)** → Determines primary role category (analytical, creative, technical, etc.)
- **Checkpoint 2 (Communication)** → Adds communication-specific scoring criteria
- **Checkpoint 3 (Quality Control)** → Adds attention to detail and accuracy categories
- **Checkpoint 4 (Pressure Management)** → Adds multitasking and deadline pressure categories
- **Checkpoint 5 (Customization)** → Adds company-specific priority categories

**Step 2: Category Generation**
```javascript
// Example for Marketing Assistant role
const scoringCategories = [
  {
    name: "Creative Innovation",
    weight: 0.30, // Role-specific emphasis
    evaluationCriteria: ["Original thinking", "Brand alignment", "Creative solutions"]
  },
  {
    name: "Professional Communication", 
    weight: 0.25, // Core competency
    evaluationCriteria: ["Clear expression", "Professional tone", "Audience awareness"]
  },
  {
    name: "Data Analysis & Accuracy",
    weight: 0.25, // Company priority
    evaluationCriteria: ["Data handling", "Insight generation", "Error detection"]
  },
  {
    name: "Values Alignment",
    weight: 0.20, // Cultural fit
    evaluationCriteria: ["Cultural fit", "Working approach", "Team compatibility"]
  }
];
```

**Step 3: Scoring Logic**
Each category is scored 0-100 based on:
- **Task Completion Quality** (40%): How well the candidate completed the challenge requirements
- **Approach and Methodology** (35%): Problem-solving process and systematic thinking
- **Communication and Presentation** (25%): How clearly results were communicated

### Tier 3: Feedback Generation (For Candidates)
**Purpose**: Provides developmental feedback to candidates
**Components**:

**Key Scores**: Category-specific performance ratings with explanations
**Strengths Highlighted**: Areas where candidate performed well (≥70% score)
**Areas for Improvement**: Categories needing development (<65% score)
**Standardized Blurb**: Context-specific explanation of assessment focus
**Next Steps**: Personalized career development recommendations
**Benchmark Comparison**: Performance relative to other candidates in similar roles

## Scoring Adaptations by Role Type

- **Professional Communication**: 25-30% weight
- **Brand Alignment**: 20-25% weight

- **Multiple Reviewer Validation**: Admin review of scoring configurations

### Calibration for Entry-Level
