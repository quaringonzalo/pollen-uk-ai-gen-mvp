# Complete Employer Checkpoint System - Final Specification

**Last Updated: June 26, 2025**  
**Status: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED - Assessment configuration checkpoints active**

## Overview

Employers progress through 6 total checkpoints from job posting to candidate matching configuration. Total time: 25-30 minutes across the full process.

**Complete Checkpoint Flow:**
1. **Job Posting Creation** (10-15 minutes)
2. **Role Context & Environment** (5-6 minutes) 
3. **Role-Specific Deep Dive** (6-7 minutes) - *Dynamic based on Checkpoint 2*
4. **Scenario-Based Assessment** (6-7 minutes) - *Dynamic based on Checkpoint 2*
5. **Challenge Calibration** (8-9 minutes) - *Dynamic based on Checkpoint 2*
6. **Persona Review & Challenge Refinement** (4-5 minutes)

**Key Principle**: Persona-supported challenge design - system generates ideal candidate persona to build employer confidence, then creates bespoke challenges and matching criteria.

## Two-Stage Matching Algorithm

### **Stage 1: Practical Requirements Filter (Pass/Fail)**
- **Visa/Work Authorization**: Right to work status, sponsorship compatibility
- **Location Compatibility**: Geographic accessibility, remote work capability
- **Job Type Alignment**: Full-time vs part-time vs contract vs permanent
- **Employment Type**: Office vs remote vs hybrid compatibility
- **Driving License**: Valid license where role requires driving
- **Salary Range**: Candidate minimum â‰¤ role maximum offered

### **Stage 2: Weighted Compatibility Scoring**
- **70% Skills Assessment**: Foundation + role-specific challenges
- **30% Behavioral Match**: DISC compatibility + work style alignment

## Complete Checkpoint Flow

### **Checkpoint 1: Job Posting Creation** (10-15 minutes)
**Purpose**: Create and publish the job posting before assessment configuration

**Sub-Steps**:
1. **Job Description Builder**: Role details, responsibilities, requirements
2. **Practical Requirements**: Location, salary, work arrangements, driving license needs
3. **Final Interview Process Design**: Post-shortlist interview stages (1-4 steps)
4. **Preview & Submit**: Review and publish job posting

**Output**: Job posting submitted for review

**Status**: Job posting under review (usually approved within 4 hours during business hours). Employers can proceed to assessment configuration while awaiting approval or wait for confirmation.

   - Completion timeline and format

3. **Refinement Options**: Customize the initial draft
   - Adjust scenario complexity
   - Add company-specific context
   - Modify assessment priorities
   - Fine-tune evaluation criteria

**Output**: Refined challenge + persona confirmation for admin review

### **Post-Checkpoint Process**
After completing all 6 checkpoints, the system shows:

**"Finalizing Your Assessment Process"**
- Loading screen with progress indicator
- Message: "Our team is reviewing and optimizing your initial challenge draft"
- Timeline: "You'll receive your refined assessment within 24 hours"
- Note: "This builds on the initial draft you reviewed to ensure perfect candidate fit"

## **Backend Admin Review Process**

2. **Job Posting Details**: Submitted job posting from Checkpoint 1 (pending approval)
3. **Ideal Candidate Persona**: Generated profile from Checkpoints 2-5
4. **Initial Challenge Draft**: Employer-reviewed draft from Checkpoint 6
5. **Refinement Notes**: Employer customizations and preferences
6. **Quality Checklist**:
   - Entry-level appropriate difficulty
   - Clear assessment criteria
   - Realistic completion time (30-120 minutes)
   - Professional language and scenarios
   - Skills-behavioral balance maintained

**Admin Actions**:
