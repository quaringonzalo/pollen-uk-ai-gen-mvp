## Assessment Methodology

### Current Dual-Selection Format
All current questions use the forced-choice methodology:
- **Most like me**: Respondent selects the option that best describes them (+3 points to corresponding DISC color)
- **Least like me**: Respondent selects the option least like them (-1.5 points from corresponding DISC color)

### Scoring System
- Each response contributes differently weighted scores to Red/Yellow/Green/Blue dimensions
- Raw scores are normalized to percentages that sum to 100%
- Validation questions check for consistency
- Social desirability bias is measured and reported

### Statistical Validity Features
- **Consistency Checking**: Validation question pairs ensure reliable responses
- **Social Desirability Detection**: Identifies responses that may be artificially positive
- **Reliability Scoring**: Overall validity score determines if results are reliable for matching
- **Forced Choice Benefits**: Reduces middle-ground responses and social desirability bias

## Question Evolution Summary

2. **Enhanced Format (30 questions)**: Dual-selection methodology with age-appropriate language  
3. **Proposed Reduction (15 questions)**: Selected subset maintaining statistical validity

The current 30-question assessment represents the most refined and statistically robust version, with the proposed 15-question reduction carefully preserving the most effective and engaging questions while maintaining adequate coverage of all DISC dimensions.
