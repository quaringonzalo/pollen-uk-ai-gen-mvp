Great work so far — the PDF export is very close to final. To complete the job, please address the following four issues:

🛠️ 1. Expand Content to Full Page Width
The content should expand to fill the full printable width of an A4 page, while retaining a narrow margin (e.g. 16–24px on each side).

This prevents unnecessary whitespace and ensures maximum use of space for a clean, professional layout.

✅ Suggested fix:

Remove any max-width constraints or tight wrappers (like .container { max-width: ... }) on /profile-print.

Use padding: 16px or margin: auto for spacing instead.

🛠️ 2. Prevent Text Overflow Inside Cards
Some cards (like “Career Motivators”) currently allow text to spill out or touch the edge.

Ensure text always wraps properly and respects inner padding.

✅ Suggested fix:

Add overflow-wrap: break-word; word-break: break-word; to text containers.

Confirm all cards have padding: 16px–24px and box-sizing: border-box.

🛠️ 3. Fix Missing Icons/Emojis
Emojis/icons (like the profile type or section icons) are not rendering properly in the exported PDF.

These may be SVGs, emoji characters, or icon fonts — Puppeteer might be missing required font or emoji rendering support.

✅ Suggested fix:

Ensure emojis are rendered using a supported font (like Noto Color Emoji) or are replaced with inline SVG if needed.

Add --font-render-hinting=medium and --no-sandbox flags to the Puppeteer launch config if emoji rendering fails.

Optionally use page.emulateMediaType('screen') to render as expected in browser.

🛠️ 4. Add Loading Feedback for User
Currently, when clicking Download PDF, there’s a long silent delay before the file appears in the browser.

This creates confusion and makes it unclear whether the export is working.

✅ Suggested fix:

Show a temporary loading message or spinner while the request is in progress (e.g. Downloading your profile...).

Disable the button or show a progress bar to reassure the user.

Re-enable or update the UI once the download is triggered or fails.

✅ Summary of Context
The PDF is being generated via Puppeteer screenshot of /profile-print (please do not revert to CSS-to-PDF).

Sidebar is now correctly hidden in the print view — great!

These changes will polish the experience and get the export feature fully production-ready.
