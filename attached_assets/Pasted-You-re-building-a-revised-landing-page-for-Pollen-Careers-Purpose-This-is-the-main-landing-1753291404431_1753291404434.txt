You're building a revised landing page for Pollen Careers.

**Purpose:**
This is the main landing page and is primarily targeted at **job seekers**. It should immediately communicate Pollen’s value, feel warm and energetic, and drive users into the **interactive job seeker demo** with **zero friction**.

**Key changes:**

* Remove the role dropdown – the “Explore Demo” button should go directly to the job seeker demo.
* Deprioritise employer messaging, but still provide a CTA for employers to go to separate landing page and enquire.
* Hide admin access from the main page (accessible only via direct URL /admin).
* Design should be clean, mobile-friendly, and highlight trust and social impact.

### 💬 Success Stories

> "From the very first task-based assignment, I knew I had found something special. The team’s feedback and communication were exceptional, and their friendliness and supportiveness made the experience even better. Thanks to Pollen, my confidence during my job search has significantly improved. In fact, I found my current job advertised through Pollen. I can’t recommend Pollen enough – they truly are a game-changer." — *Gabby*

> "During an interview, I was once told that my CV poorly reflected who I am as a person and the value I could bring to a role. It became clear that the issue wasn't my skills or the demand for someone like me – it was miscommunication. That’s where Pollen made a difference for me. They gave me an opportunity to show my potential in real-life scenarios directly relevant to the role." — *Sanelisa*
