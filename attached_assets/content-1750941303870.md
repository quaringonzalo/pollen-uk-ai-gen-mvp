# Skills Challenge

You’ve just joined Mobsta as a Designer. You’ve been asked to audit the current brand look and feel, then suggest how it could evolve visually while staying true to its identity as a bold, data-led, B Corp ad-tech company.

# 1\. Before and After Snapshot

Choose one branded element (e.g. a social post, landing page, or logo treatment) and show:

What’s working about the current version?

What would you refine or modernise?

●​ A quick side-by-side visual of the current vs your refreshed take (this can be rough – we just want to see your thinking)

# 2\. Apply Your Updated Style Across Two Formats

Using your refreshed look and feel, create visual mockups for two of the following:

A social post (Instagram or LinkedIn style) A web banner (leaderboard or mobile) A slide from a company pitch or deck

Keep it simple but show how the refreshed style holds together across different formats.

This Skills Challenge gives you the freedom to showcase your strengths, whether they come from agency work, personal projects, freelance gigs, or self taught exploration. We are not just looking for something polished; we want to see your thinking, creativity, and potential.
