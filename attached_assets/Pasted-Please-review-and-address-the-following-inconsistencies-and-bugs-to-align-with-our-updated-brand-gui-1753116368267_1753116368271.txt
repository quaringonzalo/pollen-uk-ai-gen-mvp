Please review and address the following inconsistencies and bugs to align with our updated brand guidelines:

1. Logo Implementation
Replace all instances of the old purple “P” logo with the new honeycomb logo (attached: honeycomb.png) in both the header and footer of the landing page and across the platform.

Remove or replace any legacy iconography that doesn’t match our current visual identity.

2. Font & Typography
Ensure consistent use of:

Sora for all headings

Poppins for all body text

Verify that no legacy typefaces (e.g. the previous serif-style heading font) are still rendering anywhere.

3. Brand Colours
Primary Palette

Yellow: #ffde59

Pink: #E2007A

Off-black: #272727

Accent/Functional Colours (Fixed Use Only)
These are only to be used in the DISC chart and key UI status elements:

Red: #FF8A8A — Dominance

Blue: #5A8CFF — Conscientiousness

Yellow: #FFE174 — Influence

Green: #8ED68F — Steadiness

UI Consistency Rules

Pinks should be used sparingly for CTAs, icons, and headings, not as the primary background.

Yellow should be used:

In hover states

For notifications

In light backgrounds for cards

Ensure text remains legible over yellow or light backgrounds (use #272727 or darker).

Re-audit pages like “Community” and “Messages” for colour overuse or low contrast.

4. Component Styling Bugs
Some cards still appear in purple — ensure they're restyled using the appropriate yellow or light grey background.

Review the “My Applications” and “Messages” pages — there are inconsistencies in button colours, badge styles, and component backgrounds.

Fix the user icon (currently purple). It should either:

Match the honeycomb style, or

Use a neutral base (e.g. light grey, white) with text or gradient styling matching the Pollen theme.

On hover/focus, ensure consistent transitions and semantic feedback.

5. Language Localisation
Update all text to use UK English spelling, e.g.:

“behavioural” not “behavioral”

“personalised” not “personalized”

Check for hardcoded copy or config defaults that may be defaulting to US spellings.

6. Design Philosophy Summary
Stick to a clean, minimal look — the goal is to appear modern and human while still trustworthy and tech-forward.

Use colour sparingly to draw attention, not overwhelm.

The design should feel like a unified system — avoid ad-hoc styling for individual cards, buttons, or banners.
