# Skills Challenge: K7 Media - Administrative Assistant Guideline time: 60-90 minutes

Proactivity $^ +$ Cultural Alignment:

1)​ Why did you apply? Explain in your own words, what appeals to you about the role.

2)​ What’s your favourite TV show and why?

Organisation $^ +$ Written Communication:

3)​ You’re supporting the team in the run-up to three major media events happening in June:

Seriancamp in Cologne, Germany ESI (E-Sports) in London Sheffield DocFest

Your involvement will include arranging tickets on behalf of K7 attendees, coordinating travel and accommodation, and making sure everything runs smoothly.

Prepare an email to your manager with next steps on arranging attendance, explaining when and where it’s held, how they go about securing tickets, the relevant ticket prices, and any other information you feel is relevant. Please feel free to ask your manager any questions that could help you, as they are knowledgeable about all of the events.

Notes: We’d want them to put together a well structured email which clearly outlines the key information about each of the events. Things to note:

The Seriancamp website is a little confusing to someone who might not be familiar with the event! They will likely need to do a bit of browsing to find the “accreditation” page which explains the process. A log in is also required, so it would be good to see them ask if the company already has a log in.

Upon further investigation, it appears that ESI London won’t be continuing, and there won’t be an event this year, so they will need to flag this.

Sheffield DocFest is much easier to navigate and source tickets / ticket prices. However the event is held over 6 days and there’s the option to purchase an Industry Pass for the whole event. So they may want to seek clarification on which option is preferred.

# Attention to Detail $^ +$ Written Communication:

4)​ You’ve been asked to input a list of new clients into the CRM system. These clients receive personalised international media reports, so it’s really important their names, regions and subscriptions are recorded accurately. Here is a draft of the data

provided to you - please review it and draft an email to your manager seeking clarification on any mistakes or inconsistencies you can find.

The following table will be attached in pdf format so they can’t upload to Chat GPT.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Client Name | Region | Subscription |
| Aiko Tanaka | Asia | Report A |
| Joao Lima | Europe | Report B |
| Maria Gonzalez | LATAM | Report A |
| Jorg Neuman | Europe | Report A |
| Aisha El-Mahdi | Middle East | Report C |
| Akio Tanaka | Asia | Report A |
| Maria Gonzales | LATAM | Report A |
| Jorge Nuemann | Europe | Report A |
| Aisha El-Mahdi | Middle East | Report C |
| Cho-hee Park | Asia | Report B |
| Joanna Lemieux | Europe | Report A |
| Joao Lima | LATAM | Report B |
| Garry van den Berg | Europe | Report A |
| Gary van den Berg | Europe | Report B |
| Cho-Hee Park | Asia | Report B |

Notes: We’d want them to put together a concise email which clearly outlines each of the potential errors:

João Lima appears twice with different regions (Europe vs LATAM).

Aiko vs Akio Tanaka – similar names, may be duplicate or just similar.

Maria Gonzales is a likely misspelling of María González.

Chō-Hee Park and Cho-hee Park — inconsistent formatting of the same name.

Aisha El-Mahdi vs Aïsha El-Mahdi — one may be correct, or one may be a typo.

Gary vs Garry van den Berg — possible error in name duplication, plus each name is subscribed to a different report.

Jörg Neuman vs Jorge Nuemann – possible error in name duplication.
