You're building a revised landing page for Pollen Careers.

**Purpose:**  
This is the main landing page and is primarily targeted at **job seekers**. It should immediately communicate Pollen‚Äôs value, feel warm and energetic, and drive users into the **interactive job seeker demo** with **zero friction**.

**Key changes:**
- Remove the role dropdown ‚Äì the ‚ÄúExplore Demo‚Äù button should go directly to the job seeker demo.
- Deprioritise employer messaging, but still provide a small CTA for employers to enquire.
- Hide admin access from the main page (accessible only via direct URL like /admin).
- Design should be clean, mobile-friendly, and highlight trust and social impact.
