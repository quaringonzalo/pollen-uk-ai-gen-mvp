I've successfully addressed all four issues you mentioned:

✓ Added clear star rating explanation - now shows "applicant rating" with tooltip explaining it's from candidates who completed assessments
✓ Made job types more distinct - Pollen Approved jobs have pink badges with shield icons, External jobs have gray outline badges
✓ Fixed salary formatting - all salaries now properly display £ symbol
✓ Removed time descriptions from card view as they're not relevant at this stage
✓ Updated all job salaries to be £25,000 or above (no more under £25,000 jobs)

The jobs page now has much clearer distinctions between job types and proper salary formatting throughout.

You've lost the functionality for the company to be clickable to go to their profile (pollen approved jobs only).

You're right - I need to restore the clickable company functionality for Pollen approved jobs. Let me add that back by making the company name clickable to go to their profile page.

Make company names clickable to view company profiles

I've restored the clickable company functionality for Pollen approved jobs:

✓ Company names in Pollen approved jobs are now clickable buttons
✓ They navigate to company profile pages using /company/company-name-slug format
✓ Hover effects show Pollen pink color and underline
✓ External job company names remain as plain text (non-clickable)
✓ Applied to both main job cards and "More Opportunities" sections

The distinction is now clear - only Pollen approved companies have clickable profiles, while external job companies are just text.

The copy at the top of the page still isn't that clear - can you make it visually clearer what Pollen approved means and what it means if they are not pollen approved. The users will probably not read this if it's not obvious.

You're absolutely right - the current benefits section at the top is too text-heavy and not visually clear about the distinction. Let me redesign it to make it immediately obvious what Pollen approved means vs external jobs.

I've redesigned the top section to make it visually much clearer what Pollen approved means vs external jobs:

✓ Side-by-side comparison cards with distinct visual styling
✓ Pink branding and gradient for Pollen approved jobs with benefits clearly shown
✓ Gray styling for external jobs with clear explanation they redirect elsewhere
✓ Green checkmarks for Pollen benefits vs empty boxes for external requirements
✓ Instantly scannable - users can see "No CV required" vs "Traditional CV submission" at a glance

The new design makes the distinction immediately obvious without requiring users to read lengthy text.

Remove this copy: Apply to jobs with custom assessments designed for each role - as this is only applicable to pollen approved jobs

The card for external jobs look like tick boxes - we wouldn't know the application process as we aren't managing it. Instead of what you've written can you include the explanation we had previously ie these are jobs that look entry-level friendly however will require own research, etc.

These cards look like a key but external jobs don't have an icon next to them

Just now
I'll fix these three issues:


Edited client/src/pages/jobs.tsx

Edited client/src/pages/jobs.tsx
Perfect! I've successfully fixed all three issues:

✅ Removed the misleading copy - Removed "Apply to jobs with custom assessments designed for each role" since this only applies to Pollen approved jobs

✅ Fixed external jobs description - Replaced the confusing tick box style content with the clearer explanation: "These jobs are from external websites and redirect to company sites or job boards. They're included for their entry-level appeal - please research the company and role thoroughly before applying."

✅ Added icons to external job badges - Now external job badges have the ExternalLink icon next to them, making them consistent with Pollen approved jobs that have the Shield icon

The changes make the interface much clearer:

No misleading copy about custom assessments (which aren't for all jobs)
Clear explanation that external jobs need research and redirect elsewhere
Visual consistency with icons on both job type badges

Restarted Start application

Employer Checkpoint Flow Restructure Proposal
Current Issues
Current 6-checkpoint system feels "confusing and overwhelming"
Job posting completion feels disconnected from assessment configuration
Checkpoints 2-4 cover similar territory and could be consolidated
Flow lacks clear progression and user understanding
Proposed New Structure
Checkpoint 1: Job Posting Creation (10-15 minutes)
What it includes: Complete existing 4-step job posting process

Job Description Builder: Role details, responsibilities, requirements
Practical Requirements: Location, salary, work arrangements, driving license needs
Final Interview Process Design: Post-shortlist interview stages (1-4 steps)
Preview & Submit: Review and publish job posting
Output: Job posting submitted for review

Status: Job posting under review (usually approved within 4 hours during business hours). Employers can proceed to assessment configuration while awaiting approval.

Why this works:

Users already understand job posting as first step
Natural starting point that establishes role context
Completion gives sense of progress before assessment configuration
Checkpoint 2: Assessment Configuration (20-25 minutes)
What it includes: Merge current checkpoints 2-5 into comprehensive assessment setup

Role Context & Environment (5-6 minutes)
Role-Specific Deep Dive (6-7 minutes) - Dynamic based on task selections
Scenario-Based Assessment (6-7 minutes) - Dynamic based on role demands
Challenge Calibration (8-9 minutes) - Dynamic based on role complexity
Presentation approach:

Single flowing form with clear section headers
Progress indicator showing 4 main sections within the checkpoint
Estimated completion time: 20-25 minutes total
Save progress functionality between sections
Full dynamic adaptation preserved: Sections 2-4 completely filter questions based on section 1 task selections
Output: Role-specific challenge generation + DISC requirement mapping + Communication-focused challenge elements + Quality-focused challenge components + Pressure-testing challenge elements

Checkpoint 3: Persona Review & Challenge Refinement (4-5 minutes)
What it includes:

Review generated ideal candidate persona showing system understanding
Preview auto-generated initial challenge draft
Customize the initial draft with refinement options
Adjust scenario complexity and add company-specific context
Modify assessment priorities and fine-tune evaluation criteria
Input: Data from Checkpoint 2 to generate persona and initial challenge

Output: Refined challenge + persona confirmation for admin review

Checkpoint 4: Admin Review & Activation
What it includes:

Automated backend review process
Challenge optimization and approval
Final activation of matching system
Timeline: Challenge activated within 24 hours of submission

Job Matching and Filtering System - AUTHORITATIVE DOCUMENTATION
Core Principle: NO ACADEMIC OR EXPERIENCE SCREENING
CRITICAL: This platform does NOT screen candidates by academic background or experience. We are explicitly values/behavior-first.

Two-Stage System
Stage 1: Practical Requirements Filter (Job Seeker View)
Purpose: Job seekers only see jobs they can practically do Criteria (must pass ALL to see the job):

Visa/Work Authorization: Can legally work in required location
Location Compatibility: Can work from required location (remote/hybrid/office)
Job Type Alignment: Matches permanent/temporary/contract preference
Employment Type: Matches full-time/part-time preference
Salary Range Compatibility: Job salary range overlaps with their requirements
Driving License: If required for role, candidate must have it
What this means: If a candidate doesn't meet these basic practical requirements, they never see the job listing at all.

Stage 2: Employer Scoring (After Application)
Purpose: How candidates are ranked for employers who review applications Weighting:

60% Skills: From bespoke assessment completion and quality
30% Behavioral: From DISC behavioral assessment alignment with role requirements
10% Proactivity: From community engagement and learning activities
What this means: All candidates who apply have already passed the practical filter. Employers see them ranked by this 60/30/10 split.

Personalization vs Screening
Job Recommendations (What Job Seekers See)
Personalization: Behavioral compatibility and interests influence which jobs are shown first
NOT Screening: All practically compatible jobs are still browsable
Purpose: Help candidates find roles they'd enjoy, not exclude them from opportunities
Key Distinction
Filter: Excludes jobs completely (practical requirements only)
Personalization: Reorders jobs for better recommendations (behavioral/interests)
Scoring: Ranks candidates for employers (skills + behavioral + proactivity)
Technical Implementation Notes
Stage 1 filtering happens in job discovery (frontend job lists)
Stage 2 scoring happens in compatibility-scoring.ts (employer application review)
No "skills potential" calculations - we don't predict ability from background
Behavioral matching is for fit assessment, not capability screening

DISC Role Compatibility Logic
Overview
This document outlines how work style preferences and strengths are determined based on DISC behavioral assessment scores for users aged 18-30. Rather than prescriptive job titles, we focus on work environments and approaches where people naturally thrive.

DISC Dimensions
Red (Dominance): Direct, results-oriented, decisive, competitive
Yellow (Influence): Outgoing, enthusiastic, optimistic, people-focused
Green (Steadiness): Patient, reliable, team-oriented, supportive
Blue (Conscientiousness): Analytical, precise, systematic, quality-focused
Holistic Approach to Role Compatibility
Instead of rigid job categories, we identify work styles and environments where people naturally excel. Most roles require multiple skills, and successful people come from diverse behavioral backgrounds.

Work Style Preferences Based on DISC Strengths
High Red (35%+) - Results-Driven Approach
Natural strengths in environments with:

Clear goals and measurable outcomes
Autonomy and decision-making authority
Fast-paced, dynamic challenges

Context matters: Company culture, team dynamics, and specific responsibilities matter more than job titles

Simplified Pricing Structure - Two Options Only
Overview
Complete simplification of employer pricing to reduce overwhelm and decision fatigue. Employers see only two clear options regardless of company size:

DIY Option - Employer manages the process themselves
Fully Managed Option - Pollen handles everything for the employer
Important: One Role, Multiple Hires
Each listing covers one unique role (e.g., "Marketing Assistant", "Customer Service Representative")
Hire multiple people for that role at no extra cost (e.g., hire 3 Marketing Assistants from one listing)
Multiple distinct roles require separate listings (e.g., Marketing Assistant + Sales Assistant = 2 separate purchases)
Pricing Tiers by Company Size
Micro Companies (1-10 employees)
Temporary Hire DIY: £500
Temporary Hire Fully Managed: £1,000
Permanent Hire DIY: £1,000
Permanent Hire Fully Managed: £2,000
Small Companies (11-50 employees)
Temporary Hire DIY: £750
Temporary Hire Fully Managed: £1,500
Permanent Hire DIY: £1,500
Permanent Hire Fully Managed: £3,000

Temporary Hire Fully Managed: £3,000
Permanent Hire DIY: £3,000
Permanent Hire Fully Managed: £6,000
Tenure-Based Pricing Logic

Permanent Hire: Contracts 6 months or longer (including permanent positions)
Examples
3-month contract: Uses temporary pricing
6-month contract: Uses permanent pricing
12-month contract: Uses permanent pricing
Permanent position: Uses permanent pricing
Special Case: Freelancer/Contract Hiring
Requires consultation - Different pricing model
Directs to booking consultation call

Price automatically calculated based on three factors
Required Job Posting Questions
Company Size: "How many employees does your company have?"

1-10 employees (Micro)

Pricing Calculation: System determines temp/permanent based on duration
Service Selection: Simple two-option choice (DIY vs Fully Managed)
Pricing Display: Shows only relevant prices for their situation

Checkout: Single price, clear service description
Pricing Display Logic Examples

  // Get base pricing for company size and hire type
  const basePricing = PRICING_MATRIX[companySize][hireType];
  
  // Apply service level multiplier
  const multiplier = serviceLevel === 'fully_managed' ? 2 : 1;
  
  return basePricing * multiplier;
}
