Testing People Skills and how they’d handle an awkward situation:

# Task 1: Handling an awkward face to face encounter

You are attending a face-to-face meeting with a regular, long standing client. The conversation so far has been friendly and they seem generally pleased with the service. However, at the end of the meeting they want to discuss some aspects that they are not happy with. These concerns relate to a bad customer service experience, and an occasion when the delivery of their order was later than expected. They seem quite annoyed about this, especially as they usually get a great service from the team.
