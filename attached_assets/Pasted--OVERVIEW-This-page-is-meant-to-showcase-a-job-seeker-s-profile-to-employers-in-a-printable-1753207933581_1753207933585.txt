// ✅ OVERVIEW:
// This page is meant to showcase a job seeker's profile to employers in a printable/previewable format.
// Right now, the content is too light in key insight areas and inconsistent in design hierarchy.

/////////////////////
// 🔧 CHANGES NEEDED:
/////////////////////

// ✅ 1. Include Key Behavioural Insights:
-- Add the following *explicitly* (if available from assessment results):
   • Communication Style (e.g. “Patient and encouraging” — expand to 1-2 sentences if possible)
   • Decision-Making Style (e.g. “Analytical and risk-averse” or “Collaborative and intuitive”)
   • Career Motivators (Top 2, if selected)
   • Compatible Role Types (Top 2-3 from system mapping)

-- These can be placed in a new section called: “How I Work” or “Behavioural Preferences”
-- Layout: 2-column grid or full-width list-style with subtle icons or tags

// ✅ 2. Remove Redundant Bullet Points:
-- The bullet-pointed “Key Strengths” under DISC breakdown are too vague/repetitive.
-- Delete these (e.g. "Reliability", "Patience") unless we turn them into real paragraphs (already done in the Key Strengths section on the right).

// ✅ 3. Fix Layout Logic:
-- “Key Strengths” on the right is strong: leave this as-is, but consider limiting to top 2 or 3 and allow full-width display on smaller screens.

-- Remove visual duplication across left and right if data already exists elsewhere.

-- Ensure “Ideal Work Environment” and “Interested Role Types” are clearly grouped under a “Career Interests” or “Work Preferences” block near the bottom of the left column (or in a full-width row).

// ✅ 4. Optional Improvements:
-- Add headline summary: A short generated line like “Reliable, team-focused communicator who thrives in collaborative environments.”
-- If no references are available, either hide the section or show a greyed-out prompt: “No references added yet.”

// ✅ 5. Style Guide:
-- Use consistent padding: `p-6` for all cards
-- Border radius: `rounded-xl`
-- Use same color scheme and fonts as `/profile` tab
-- Max width: `max-w-6xl mx-auto px-6`
-- Font sizes: `text-lg` for section headers, `text-sm` for supporting text
