# Skills Challenge

Why did you apply?

What is it about the work Separate Space that motivates you to apply for this role?

Attached you will find some guidance that SeparateSpace has put together specifically on how to create a parenting schedule. This exercise is designed to help people think about the key factors that influence what schedule is right for their children. The aim is to help them create a schedule that works for their children emotionally and practically, as well as being workable for the adults involved.

You’ll use this information to create a few marketing materials, including an Instagram post (you can choose between a graphic or a reel) and a blog post. The goal is to communicate the key points clearly while staying true to the brand’s style and voice.

Feel free to check out their socials and previous blog posts for more context. They’re a great way to see how the brand communicates and get a sense of their tone.

We’re looking for creativity, clarity, and engagement. Good luck!
