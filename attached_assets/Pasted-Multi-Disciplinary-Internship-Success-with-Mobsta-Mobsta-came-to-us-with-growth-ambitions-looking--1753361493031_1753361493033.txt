Multi-Disciplinary Internship Success with Mobsta
Mobsta came to us with growth ambitions, looking for a long term partner who could identify the right talent that could grow with the business. As a B Corp, culture and values were critically important.

Mobsta came to Pollen for help with their recruitment as they faced challenges in scaling and finding the right people for their growing business. The company’s top-heavy structure, where senior leaders are deeply involved in both day-to-day operations and strategic growth, was seen as a barrier to expanding efficiently. 


They had experimented with recruiters and LinkedIn Jobs for junior roles, but the results didn’t meet their expectations. The recruitment process had become slow and often frustrating, with CEO Matt and his leadership team juggling hiring duties alongside their core responsibilities.


This is where Pollen stepped in. We understood that Mobsta needed more than just traditional recruitment services—we needed to align with their values and bring along proactive young people eager to contribute to the company's growth. We focused on the qualities that matter most to Mobsta—attitude, personality, and a genuine commitment to the company’s culture—rather than just technical experience.


By streamlining their recruitment processes and focusing on a broader pool of candidates, we helped Mobsta connect with top talent more efficiently. With Pollen’s support, Mobsta was able to focus on what they do best, knowing they had a trusted partner handling the recruitment process, helping them build a team that would be instrumental in their continued growth.

What was the biggest challenge you faced with hiring before you started using Pollen?

I'd say the biggest challenge we faced was maybe just being stuck in our ways a little bit with our approach. We were typically focusing on a particular level, trying to recruit reactively, maybe not as proactively, and often trying to fill roles that opened up due to people leaving or to serve a certain customer need. 


We weren’t really thinking in the long term, nor were we thinking about how to create some structure around the future of our business. We saw an opportunity to bring people in at a different level to develop them internally, and that's something that Pollen really helped us with.



What made Pollen stand out to you compared to other hiring solutions?

Pollen stood out to me from the very first time I met with the team. When we first spoke to them, we had some roles in mind, but I didn’t know a great deal. I already had a bit of a concept in my mind of what we were trying to do, but it was new to the business. So as soon as I learned how Pollen worked—their process, their own values and the unique approach they take—it immediately aligned with what we were trying to achieve. So it just felt like the stars aligned and it was kind of perfect. 


Given your plans for growth and hiring more junior team members, how did Pollen ensure they hired someone who aligns well with your existing culture?

It was the uniqueness of the approach that just happened to really align with our business values and what we were intending to do, so it just felt perfect. From the outset, Pollen has always been able to ensure they hire someone that aligns with our culture. They really make the effort to understand our business and our people, rather than the typical experience you might have; working with recruiters in the past, they might be more focused on filling that particular role and getting someone the job. 



It always felt like Pollen made the effort to get to know us and what we were trying to do. They cared about our long-term plans, our values, and the culture we try to instill. Specifically being a B Corp and what that means for us, they made sure that this was reflected to members of their community and any potential candidates, because it always came through in the profiles that we received back. It wasn't all about one thing or one skills area. It very much reflected to us how the candidate had then understood those values a little bit more and were able to get that across in their applications. 

How has Pollen changed your overall hiring process?

Pollen has fundamentally changed our overall hiring process. I can say that confidently. We were thinking about a slightly different approach in creating these new more junior roles, but we didn't know whether it would work or whether we had the right person to help us do that. Pollen turned out to really be the exact partner we needed.


There’s numerous things actually:


- We’ve flipped our old org chart on its head to show that the senior leadership are very much in support of the rest of the business moving up. 


- We’ve created I suppose a new tier of roles. We’ve now on the back of that created an ongoing development programme for all staff with long term development in mind. 


- We’ve created a future plan for next year, which has planned open roles at that intern level.


We’ve almost built our future plans around that change of mindset for us and Pollen has been really instrumental in that.

Would you recommend Pollen to other companies?

I have already recommended Pollen to other companies! We are massive advocates and even for me personally when I’m talking to old friends who are facing similar challenges or even if they are talking about long term plans I’ve dropped them into conversation many times and sent them Pollen’s way. 


I’m always happy to talk about the success we’ve had and the changes it has made to our business. I have and will continue to recommend Pollen.
