Your task:

Break down the project into clear steps / milestones What needs to happen, in what order? Think about preparation, dependencies, timelines. What needs to be confirmed, chased, coordinated?

fine). How would you approach the project? How would you keep things moving?

Create a simple RACI matrix for 4-5 key actions.

Create a gant chart of plan of action For example, confirming the furniture delivery:

Responsible: You (Project Manager) Accountable: You Consulted: Sofas4All, CoolHomes Informed: Homewards Lead

Sofas4All said they’ve got 13 sofas ready – trying to source 2 more. No firm delivery date yet but aiming for early May.

CoolHomes Appliances didn’t attend – no update from them yet.

Eastford Housing said properties should be confirmed "within two weeks" – asked if they could aim for Friday 12 April, they said yes.

NewStart Eastford said they’re happy to start assigning support workers at the beginning of May. Need move-in dates by mid-April ideally. New contact there attended, like her, she had good energy!

Everyone agreed that the target date for the launch event should be Thurs 16 May. Town Hall availability TBC.
