# Employer Candidate Matching - Checkpoint System

## Overview
After an employer submits a job posting, they enter a structured checkpoint system to configure candidate matching preferences. This mirrors the job seeker checkpoint experience with progressive disclosure and clear navigation.

## Two-Stage Matching Algorithm

The system uses a mandatory two-stage process to ensure only eligible candidates are considered:

### **Stage 1: Practical Requirements Filter (Pass/Fail)**

All candidates must meet these essential criteria before entering compatibility scoring:

**Visa/Work Authorization**:
- Right to work in UK (or relevant country) without restrictions
- Visa status compatible with role requirements  
- No sponsorship needed if employer cannot provide

**Location Compatibility**:
- Geographic accessibility to workplace within reasonable commute
- Remote work capability if hybrid/remote role
- Willingness to relocate if required

**Job Type Alignment**:
- Full-time vs Part-time availability matching role requirements
- Contract vs Permanent preference alignment
- Internship/Graduate program eligibility if applicable

**Employment Type Preferences**:
- Office-based vs Remote vs Hybrid compatibility

**Driving License Requirements**:
- Valid driving license where role requires driving
- Vehicle access compatibility with role demands

**Salary Range Compatibility**:
- Candidate minimum salary ≤ Role maximum salary offered
- Role minimum salary ≤ Candidate maximum expected
- Benefits package alignment where critical

**Note**: Start date/availability, shift patterns, and travel requirements are displayed in job postings for transparency and candidate self-selection, but not used as filters to avoid unfairly excluding suitable candidates or becoming outdated over time.

### **Stage 2: Weighted Compatibility Scoring (70% Skills / 30% Behavioral)**

Only candidates passing ALL practical requirements proceed to refined matching:
- **70% Skills Assessment**: Foundation challenges + role-specific verification
- **30% Behavioral Match**: DISC compatibility + work style alignment

## Checkpoint Flow Design

### Checkpoint 1: Role Context & Environment
**Purpose**: Establish the foundational role requirements and working environment
**Time**: 5-6 minutes
**Completion**: Required before moving to next checkpoint

## Data Analysis & Output Generation

### Question Purpose & Analysis Framework

**Questions (6 foundational with analysis purpose)**:

1. **"What are the key tasks this person will handle?"** (select all that apply + optional text field)
   
   **Communication & Relationships**:
   - **Client Communication**: Professional emails, calls, relationship building
   - **Stakeholder Management**: Coordinating between internal teams and external clients

   - **Quality Control**: Reviewing materials before delivery, catching errors
   - **Administrative Tasks**: Documentation, filing, process management, data entry
   
   **Creative & Content**:
   - **Designing Artwork**: Creating graphics, layouts, visual materials
   - **Content Creation**: Writing copy, creating social media posts, blog content
   - **Social Media Management**: Managing channels, posting content, community engagement
   - **Creative Briefing**: Working with designers, providing feedback, managing revisions
   
   **Technical & Analysis**:
   - **Data Analysis**: Analyzing datasets, creating reports, identifying trends
   - **Software Development**: Coding, testing, debugging, technical implementation
   - **Technical Support**: Troubleshooting issues, providing technical assistance
   - **System Management**: Managing software, databases, technical infrastructure
   
   **Business & Strategy**:
   - **Financial Management**: Budget tracking, financial reporting, cost analysis
   - **Business Analysis**: Market research, process improvement, strategic planning
   - **Sales Support**: Lead qualification, proposal creation, sales administration
   - **Problem Solving**: Identifying issues, developing solutions, implementing fixes
   
   - **Other key tasks**: [Optional text field] "Describe any additional tasks specific to your role or industry..."

   **Analysis Purpose**: Skills challenge generation + DISC mapping
   **Data Processing**: 
   - **Structured selections**: Each predefined task maps to specific challenge types and DISC requirements
   - **Manual input processing**: NLP analysis extracts key action verbs and skill indicators from free text
     - Example: "Managing budgets and financial reporting" → Maps to analytical thinking + conscientiousness
     - Example: "Presenting to senior executives" → Maps to high influence + communication challenge priority
   - **Combined analysis**: Structured + manual inputs create comprehensive task profile
   - Output: Challenge priority matrix + behavioral weight adjustments + custom challenge elements

2. **"Describe the typical work environment:"** (select one)
   - Fast-paced, lots of moving parts, constant context switching
   - Steady rhythm with occasional busy periods
   - Calm, methodical environment with predictable workflows
   - Mix of intense periods and quieter project work

   **Analysis Purpose**: DISC behavioral mapping (Steadiness dimension)
   **Data Processing**: 
   - Fast-paced = Low Steadiness required (adaptable, flexible)
   - Steady rhythm = Moderate Steadiness (balanced structure/flexibility)
   - Calm/methodical = High Steadiness (prefers routine, stability)
   - Output: Steadiness score requirement for candidate matching

3. **"How much independence will this person have?"** (select one)
   - High autonomy - they set their own priorities and methods
   - Guided independence - clear objectives, flexible on approach
   - Structured role - clear processes and regular check-ins
   - Close supervision - frequent guidance and approval needed

   **Analysis Purpose**: DISC behavioral mapping (Dominance dimension)
   **Data Processing**: 
   - High autonomy = High Dominance required (decisive, independent)
   - Guided independence = Moderate Dominance (some initiative within bounds)
   - Structured role = Low-Moderate Dominance (follows guidance, collaborative)
   - Close supervision = Low Dominance (supportive, team-oriented)
   - Output: Dominance score requirement + supervision style matching

4. **"What's the client interaction level?"** (select one)
   - Direct client communication (emails, calls, meetings)
   - Indirect client work (preparing materials, behind-scenes support)
   - Internal focus with occasional external touchpoints
   - No external client interaction

   **Analysis Purpose**: DISC behavioral mapping (Influence dimension) + Skills challenge weighting
   **Data Processing**: 
   - DISC: Direct communication = High Influence (outgoing, persuasive), Indirect = Moderate Influence, Internal = Low Influence
   - Skills: Direct interaction = Heavy communication challenge weighting, Indirect = Quality control focus
   - Output: Influence score requirement + communication challenge priority

5. **"Describe the pressure and stakes:"** (select one)
   - High stakes - client-facing work with reputation/revenue impact
   - Medium stakes - important but manageable consequences
   - Lower stakes - supportive role with limited external impact
   - Variable stakes depending on project and timeline

   **Analysis Purpose**: DISC behavioral mapping (Conscientiousness + Dominance) + Pressure challenge intensity
   **Data Processing**: 
   - DISC: High stakes = High Conscientiousness (quality-focused) + Moderate-High Dominance (handles pressure)
   - Skills: High stakes = Maximum pressure challenge difficulty, Lower stakes = Reduced pressure scenarios
   - Output: Quality standards requirement + pressure challenge calibration

6. **"What's most important for day-one success?"** (open text, 2-3 sentences)
   - Placeholder: "Describe what you need this person to excel at immediately vs. what they can learn over time..."

   **Analysis Purpose**: Skills challenge prioritization + Entry-level calibration
   **Data Processing**: 
   - NLP analysis to extract key competencies mentioned
   - Skills: Mentioned competencies get weighted higher in challenge selection
   - Behavioral: Soft skills mentioned (e.g., "confident," "proactive") map to DISC adjustments
   - Output: Challenge difficulty calibration + must-have vs. nice-to-have skill categorization
