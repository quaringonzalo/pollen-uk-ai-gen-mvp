Short phrase that sits below DISC chart (e.g., "Enthusiastic and people-focused")

### 4. Key Strengths
Array of strength statements highlighting natural talents

### 5. How They Work Components

#### Communication Style
- **Employer View**: "Communication Style" 
- **Job Seeker View**: "Your Communication Style"

#### Decision-Making Style  
- **Employer View**: "Decision-Making Style"
- **Job Seeker View**: "How You Make Decisions"

#### Career Motivators
- **Both Views**: "Career Motivators"

#### Work Style Strengths
- **Both Views**: Core strengths in work approach

#### Job Seeker Only Components
- **Ideal Work Environment**: Description of optimal workplace
- **Compatible Role Types**: Types of roles that suit this personality

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Implemented
- [x] Personality type determination logic (21+ types)
- [x] Single statement descriptors for employer view
- [x] Basic key strengths generation function

### ❌ Missing/Incomplete
- [ ] Complete behavioral summary generation for all 21+ types
- [ ] Brief DISC summary phrases for all types
- [ ] Communication style mapping for all types
- [ ] Decision-making style mapping for all types  
- [ ] Career motivators mapping for all types
- [ ] Work style strengths for all types
- [ ] Ideal work environment descriptions (job seeker only)
- [ ] Compatible role types (job seeker only)
- [ ] Comprehensive generation functions for all components

## Next Steps Required

1. **Create comprehensive generation functions** for all missing components
2. **Map each of the 21+ personality types** to specific:
   - Communication styles
   - Decision-making approaches  
   - Career motivators
   - Work style strengths
   - Ideal environments (job seeker)
   - Compatible roles (job seeker)
3. **Update backend API** to generate all components consistently
4. **Update frontend displays** to use generated data instead of fallbacks
5. **Ensure consistency** between employer view and job seeker profile view

## Brand Tone Requirements
- Use conversational, energetic language
- Avoid formal terms like "professional"
- Use British English spellings
- Focus on growth potential and positive traits
- Make descriptions engaging and relatable

## Technical Integration Points
- Server: `/api/job-candidates/:jobId` endpoint
- Server: `/api/user-profile` endpoint
