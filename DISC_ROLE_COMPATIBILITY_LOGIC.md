# DISC Role Compatibility Logic

## Overview
This document outlines how work style preferences and strengths are determined based on DISC behavioral assessment scores for users aged 18-30. Rather than prescriptive job titles, we focus on work environments and approaches where people naturally thrive.

## DISC Dimensions
- **Red (Dominance)**: Direct, results-oriented, decisive, competitive
- **Yellow (Influence)**: Outgoing, enthusiastic, optimistic, people-focused  
- **Green (Steadiness)**: Patient, reliable, team-oriented, supportive
- **Blue (Conscientiousness)**: Analytical, precise, systematic, quality-focused

## Holistic Approach to Role Compatibility

Instead of rigid job categories, we identify work styles and environments where people naturally excel. Most roles require multiple skills, and successful people come from diverse behavioral backgrounds.

## Work Style Preferences Based on DISC Strengths

### High Yellow (25%+) - People-Focused Approach  
**Natural strengths in environments with:**
- Regular interaction and collaboration
- Opportunities to communicate and influence

## Important Notes

1. **Leadership comes in many forms:** Empathetic leaders (high green) can be just as effective as decisive leaders (high red)
2. **Roles are multifaceted:** Marketing can be analytical, creative, strategic, or relationship-focused - success depends on the specific context
3. **Multiple paths to success:** People with different DISC profiles can excel in the same role through different approaches
4. **Context matters:** Company culture, team dynamics, and specific responsibilities matter more than job titles
