# Complete 17+ Behavioral Types System - Pollen Platform

## Overview

The Pollen platform uses a sophisticated DISC-based behavioral assessment system that generates 17+ fun, engaging personality types instead of formal business terminology. The system analyzes candidates' responses to create nuanced behavioral profiles that help with job matching and team dynamics.

## How the System Works

### DISC Profile Calculation
Each candidate receives a DISC profile with four color percentages:
- **Red (Dominance)**: Drive, results-orientation, decisiveness
- **Yellow (Influence)**: People skills, enthusiasm, communication  
- **Green (Steadiness)**: Reliability, patience, team support
- **Blue (Conscientiousness)**: Analysis, quality, attention to detail

### Personality Type Determination Logic

```javascript
// 1. Pure Dominant Types (>60% OR >45% with secondary <20%)
if (primary > 60 || (primary > 45 && secondary < 20)) {
  // Single dominant trait
}

// 2. Dual Combination Types (primary >35% AND secondary >25%)  
if (primary > 35 && secondary > 25) {
  // Two strong traits combine
}

// 3. Balanced Types (no color >35% OR difference <10%)
if (primary <= 35 || (primary - secondary) < 10) {
  // Even distribution across traits
}
```
